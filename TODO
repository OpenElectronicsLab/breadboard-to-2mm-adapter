TODO: Need to double check spacing and drill values, before gerbers

TODO: review for noise
* Currently a 4 layer board to hopefully reduce amount of crosstalk where
  traces overlap or cross each other.
* while it may be as it is, it is not 100% symmetrical, and the traces
  in some quadrants overlap more than others, should this be improved?
